Here we list several interesting papers to read, Critics

- Towards Robust and Reproducible Active Learning Using Neural Networks [2020]:
  Comparative works.
  A comparative study over state-of-art Deep AL methods.
  In short, it states that compared to the well-regularized RSB, state-of-the-art AL methods evaluated in this paper do not achieve any noticeable gain.
- Parting with Illusions about Deep Active Learning [2019]:
  Comparative works.
  State the improvements from SSL and data augmentation.
