- An Interactive Multi-Label Consensus Labeling Model for Multiple Labeler Judgments [2018, AAAI]: The premise is that labels inferred with high consensus among labelers, might be closer to the ground truth. Proposed  a novel formulation that aims to collectively optimize the cost of labeling, labeler reliability, label-label correlation and inter-labeler consensus.
- Cost-effective active learning from diverse labelers [2017, AAAI]: The cost of a labeler is proportional to its overall labeling quality. But different labelers usually have diverse expertise, and thus it is likely that labelers with a low overall quality can provide accurate labels on some specific instances. Select labeler can provide an accurate label for the instance with a relative low cost.
