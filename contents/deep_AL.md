# Deep Active Learning

Deep neural network is popular in machine learning community.
Many researchers focus on how to utilize AL with neural networks or deep models in many tasks.

## Survey/Review

There already are several surveys for the DeepAL.
- A Survey of Active Learning for Text Classification using Deep Neural Networks [[2020]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07267.pdf)
- A Survey of Deep Active Learning [[2020]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00236.pdf)
- [From Model-driven to Data-driven: A Survey on Active Deep Learning [2021]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09933.pdf)


## Difficulty to utilize AL on neural networks

1. To perform active learning, a model has to be able to learn from small amounts of data and represent its uncertainty over unseen data.
2. Many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty. But in deep learning we rarely represent such model uncertainty.

# Current works

There are many works about Deep AL in the literature.
Here we only list the ones focused on the strategies or the framework design.

The taxonomy here is similar to the taxonomy [here](pb_classification.md).
However, due to the outstanding performance of semi-supervised learning in the deep learning literature, there are works include SSL into the AL framework.

| SL or SSL | Strategy Types                               | Description                                  | Famous Works                  |

| SSL-based | (We didn't specify the strategy types here.) | The SSL is conclude into the framework       |                               |

## Supervised learning based

Supervised learning based methods means the model only use the labeled instances to train the model.
Here the taxonomy is similar to the one without using neural networks.

### Representativeness-impart

Take into account the representativeness of the data.
This could be evaluated on the distribution.
Besides, the diversity of a batch could also make the selection more representative (batch mode selection).

There are following sub-categories:
- Density-based sampling 
- Diversity-based sampling (batch mode)
- Discriminator guided Sampling
- Expected loss on unlabeled data
- Graph-based

Density-based sampling:

  Provide a rigorous bound between an average loss over any given subset of the dataset and the remaining data points via the geometry of the data points.
  And choose a subset such that this bound is minimized (loss minimization).
  Try to find a set of points to query labels such that when we learn a model, the performance of the model on the labelled subset and that on the whole dataset will be as close as possible.

Besides, self-supervised learning would also bring a huge performance improvement.

# Criticism/Discovery on Deep AL

Several works compare the current DeepAL methods, and state that their experiments are flawed.
We think these papers are very interesting.
So here we give the details of each paper.

## 1. Parting with Illusions about Deep Active Learning [2019]

This work state that current state-of-art DeepAL works doesn't consider the parallel setting such as "Semi-supervised learning", "data augmentation" etc.
So they hold a comparative study on several AL strategies with SL and SSL training paradigms.
They hold the experiments on two tasks: image classification and semantic segmentation.

Results from classification task:
- AL works well with data augmentation, but data augmentation blurs the differences between AL strategies: they all perform largely the same.
- Combining SSL and AL can be yields an improvement over raw SSL.
- Relative ranking of the AL methods changes completely on different datasets
- AL selection strategy is counter-productive in the low-budget regime, even worse than Random Sampling.
- SSL-AL method clearly outperforms fine-tuning of a pre-trained ImageNet network in both high-and low-budget settings.

Results from semantic segmentation task:
- Random selection with SSL performs best

Overall conclusion:
- Current evaluation protocol used in active learning is sub-optimal which in turn leads to wrong conclusions about the methodsâ€™ performance.
- Modern semi-supervised learning algorithms applied in the conventional active learning setting show a higher relative performance increase.
- State-of-the-art active learning approaches often fail to outperform simple random sampling, especially when the labeling budget is small.

## 2. Towards Robust and Reproducible Active Learning Using Neural Networks [2020]

This work state the performance of random sampling baseline and AL strategies vary significantly over different papers.
With the goal of improving the reproducibility and robustness of AL methods, in this study they evaluate the performance of these methods for image classification compared to a random sampling in a fair experimental environment.
They also state that most AL works overlooked the regularization which would reduce the generalization error.
They hold the comparative study on different regularization setting.
(parameter norm penalty, random augmentation (RA), stochastic weighted averaging (SWA), and shake-shake (SS))

Results from image classification task:
- The performance of RS is significantly better than what they state in the other works. And there is no strategy performs clearly better than RS.
- With different AL batch size, the performance of strategies is inconsistent.
- AL methods do not outperform RS, and it isn't robust on class imbalanced setting.
- Models trained with RA and SWA consistently achieve significant performance gains across all AL iterations and exhibit appreciably smaller variance across multiple runs of the experiments.
- Consider the selected instances from VGG16 to ResNet18 and WRN-28-2, the performance varies. RS still performs well.

## 3. Effective Evaluation of Deep Active Learning on Image Classification Tasks [2021, Open Review]

Point out four issues for current AL works:
1. Contradictory observations on the performance of different AL algorithms
2. Unintended exclusion of important generalization approaches such as data augmentation and SGD for optimization
3. A lack of study of evaluation facets like the labeling efficiency of AL
4. Little or no clarity on the scenarios in which AL outperforms random sampling (RS).

They presented a unified re-implementation of state-of-the-art AL algorithms in the context of image classification.
Besides, they did a careful analysis of how existing approaches perform with varying amounts of redundancy and number of examples per class.

Point out some important details are not clear:
> - Should model training be restarted after every round, or can one fine-tune the current model? 
> - What is the effect of using carefully crafted seed sets in AL? 
> - Is there an ideal AL batch size, or does the batch size actually matter? 
> - When is AL more effective than random sampling, and what are the factors that affect the labeling efficiency of AL algorithms? Lastly, 
> - How scalable are AL algorithms; specifically, what is the amount of time taken by model training versus that taken by AL selection, and can this be made more compute and energy-efficient?

Key finding and takeaways:
> - Data augmentation and other generalization approaches have a considerable impact on the test performance as well as on the labeling efficiency.
> - SGD performs and generalizes better than Adam consistently in AL.
> - In the presence of data augmentation and the SGD optimizer, there is no significant advantage of diversity over very simple uncertainty sampling (at least in most standard academic data sets).
> - When we make the data set artificially redundant (either by repeating data points or by using near repetitions through augmentations), we see that BADGE starts outperforming uncertainty sampling.
> - The number of instances per class has an important impact on the performance of AL algorithms: The fewer the examples there are per class, the smaller the room there is for AL to improve over random sampling
> - The initialization of the labeled seed set (e.g., a random versus a more diverse or representative seed set) has little to no impact on the performance of AL after a few rounds; 
> - Reasonably sized choices of the AL batch size also have little to no impact.
> - Updating the models from previous rounds (fine-tuning) versus retraining the models from scratch negatively impacts the performance of AL only in the early selection rounds
> - The most time-consuming and energy-inefficient part of the AL loop is the model (re)training.

## 4. Reducing Label Effort: Self-Supervised meets Active Learning [2021, ICCV]

It shows that the improvements brought from AL are far less than that from self-training.
Only when the number of labeled instances approaches 50%, the gap could disappear.

## 5.  On the marginal benefit of active learning: Does self-supervision eat its cake? [2021, ICASSP]: 
Fail to observe any additional benefit of state-of-the-art active learning algorithms when combined with state-of-the-art S4L techniques.
