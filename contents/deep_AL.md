# Deep Active Learning

Deep neural network is popular in machine learning community.
Many researchers focus on how to utilize AL specifically with neural networks or deep models in many tasks.

## Survey/Review

There already are several surveys for the DeepAL.
- A Survey of Active Learning for Text Classification using Deep Neural Networks [[2020]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07267.pdf)
- A Survey of Deep Active Learning [[2020]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00236.pdf)
- [From Model-driven to Data-driven: A Survey on Active Deep Learning [2021]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09933.pdf)

## What to study on AL with DNN?

1. To perform active learning, a model has to be able to learn from small amounts of data, while it is hard to train a deep model with small amount labeled data.
2. Many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty. But in deep learning we rarely represent such model uncertainty.
3. Current semi/self-supervised learning has already achieved well performance improvement, is it still necessary to use AL?

Furthermore, several researches study on the effectiveness of AL on DNN, and provide several **criticisms**.
The relative works could be found [here](deep_AL_criticism.md).

# Current works

There are many works about Deep AL in the literature.
Here we only list the ones focused on the strategies or the framework design.

The taxonomy here is similar to the taxonomy in [pool-based classification](pb_classification.md).
However, due to the outstanding performance of semi/self-supervised learning in the deep learning literature, there are works include semi/self-supervised learning into the AL framework.

## Supervised Learning Based

Supervised learning based methods means the model only use the labeled instances to train the model.
Here the taxonomy is similar to the one without using neural networks.

### 2. Representativeness-impart

Take into account the representativeness of the data.
This could be evaluated on the distribution.
Besides, the diversity of a batch could also make the selection more representative (batch mode selection).

There are following sub-categories:
- Density-based sampling 
- Diversity-based sampling (batch mode)
- Discriminator guided Sampling
- Expected loss on unlabeled data
- Graph-based

Density-based sampling:
- [Active learning for convolutional neural networks: A core-set approach [ICLR, 2018]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00489):
  Define the problem of active learning as **core-set** selection, i.e. choosing set of points such that a model learned over the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points.
  The empirical analysis suggests that they (Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Image Data [ICML, 2017]) do not scale to large-scale datasets because of batch sampling.
  Provide a rigorous bound between an average loss over any given subset of the dataset and the remaining data points via the geometry of the data points.
  And choose a subset such that this bound is minimized (loss minimization).
  Try to find a set of points to query labels such that when we learn a model, the performance of the model on the labelled subset and that on the whole dataset will be as close as possible.
  Batch active learning.

  They use the local piece-wise interpretation in MLP as the representation of each sample, and directly run K-Center clustering to select and label samples

- DeepCore: A Comprehensive Library for Coreset Selection in Deep Learning [2022]: 
  From their experiments on CIFAR10, in small fractions of 0.1%-1%, the advantage of submodular function based methods is obvious.
  However, its superiority disappears when the coreset size increases, especially when selecting more than 30% training data.

Diversity-based sampling (batch mode):
- [BatchBALD: Efficient and Diverse Batch Acquisition for Deep Bayesian Active Learning [NeurIPS, 2019]](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8925-batchbald-efficient-and-diverse-batch-acquisition-for-deep-bayesian-active-learning):

  Use the idea from adversarial learning.
  **VAAL**.
  The intuition is to train a discriminator to decide which instance is least similar the labeled instance.
  This discriminator works as the selector.
  (The VAE is trained to fool the adversarial network to believe that all the examples are from the labeled data while the adversarial classifier is trained to differentiate labeled from unlabeled samples.) 
- [Deep Adversarial Active Learning With Model Uncertainty For Image Classification [2020, ICIP]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9190726&tag=1):
