# Multi-view Active Learning

In multi-view active learning (MVAL), each instances would have multiple forms of representations (views).
AL select instances by considering the relations among views.

Works:
- Active + Semi-Supervised Learning = Robust Multi-View Learning [2002, ICML]
- Active learning with multiple views [2006, JAIR]
- Multi-view active learning in the non-realizable case [2010, NeurIPS]
