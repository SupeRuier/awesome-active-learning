# Active Learning Summary
In this repository, previous works of active learning were categorized. 

# At the Beginning

Active learning is used to reduce the annotation cost in machine learning process.
There have been several surveys for this topic.
The main ideas and the scenarios are introduced in these surveys.

- Active learning: theory and applications [[2001]](https://ai.stanford.edu/~koller/Papers/Tong:2001.pdf.gz)
- **Active Learning Literature Survey (Recommend to read)**[[2009]](https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/60660)
- A survey on instance selection for active learning [[2012]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-012-0507-8)
- Active Learning: A Survey [[2014]](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780429102639/chapters/10.1201/b17320-27)
