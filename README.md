# Active learning summary

In this repository, previous works of active learning were categorized. 
We try to summarize the current AL works in a **problem-orientated approach** and a **technique-orientated approach**.
We also include many real-world applications of AL.
The open-source software resources and the information of relevant scholars are listed.

*(I can't ensure this summary covers all the representative works and ideas.
So if you have any comments and recommendations, pls let me know.)*

# At the Beginning

Active learning is used to reduce the annotation cost in machine learning process.
It is under the assumption that some samples are more important for a given task than other samples.
There have been several surveys for this topic.
They provided a good overview for the field.

# Problem-oriented approach

Firstly, we summarized the previous works in a problem-oriented order.
We note that, in this section we don't focus on what the algorithms look like.
However, we try to identify the exact problem settings and list the applicable methods (or works) for the corresponding settings.
In other words, we need to understand what specific problems are active learning trying to solve.

We divided the problem settings into three types:
1. Basic Problem Settings
   - Under the basic scenarios: Pool-based/Stream-based/Query synthesis
   - Under the basic tasks: Classification/Regression
2. Advanced Problem Settings
   - Under many variants of machine learning problem settings.
3. Problem Settings from other Research Fields
   - With more complex tasks or problem settings in other research fields

## Basic Problem Settings

According to three types of scenarios and two basic tasks, almost all the AL works could be divided into the following sub-problems.
Please check [here](AL_problem.md) for more details.

|                | Pool-based                     | Stream-based         | Query synthesis |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- | :-------------: |
| Classification | PB-classification (most works) | SB-classification    |        -        |
| Regression     | PB-regression                  | SB-regression (rare) |        -        |

## Advanced Problem Settings

There are many variants of machine learning problem settings.
Under these problem settings, AL could be further applied.

- [Multi-class active learning](subfields/MCAL.md): In a classification task, each instance has one label from several possible classes.
- [Multi-label active learning](subfields/MLAL.md): In a classification task, each instance has multiple labels.
- [Multi-task active learning](subfields/MTAL.md): The model or set of models handles multiple different tasks simultaneously. For instance, handle two classification tasks at the same time, or one classification and one regression. Multi-domain: Similar to multi-task, but the data are from different datasets(domains). The model or set of models handles multiple datasets simultaneously.
- [Multi-domain active learning](subfields/MDAL.md): Similar to multi-task, but the data are from different datasets(domains). The model or set of models handles multiple datasets simultaneously.
- [Multi-view/modal active learning](subfields/MVAL.md): The instances might have different views (different sets of features). The model or set of models handles different views simultaneously.

## Problem Settings from other Research Fields

In many research fields, the problem settings can't be simply divided into supervised classification or regression problem.
They either acquire a different types of output or assume a unusual learning process.
So AL algorithms should be revised/developed for these problem settings.
Here we summarized several related research fields which use AL to reduce the cost of annotation.

TODO need to be updated
- Computer vision (CV)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Domain adaptation/Transfer learning
- Graph data
- Metric learning/Pairwise comparison/Similarity learning
- One-shot learning
- Clustering
- Generative Adversarial Network
- De-noise
- Causal Analysis
- Positive and unlabeled (PU) learning
- Reinforcement Learning

The list of works could see [here](subfields/AL_combinations.md)

# Technique-oriented Approach

After we specifying the problems,the way to derive active learning algorithms should be considered.
This section contains two partsï¼š
- Taxonomy in AL strategies
- AL strategies under different models

There might be overlaps between these two parts. 
Here we just provide two different dimensions for you to find the information you need.

## Taxonomy in AL Strategies (Pool-based Classification)

In this section, we provide our taxonomy in the current AL strategies.
We hope this can bring you a intuition to design your own strategy or just choose the most appropriate strategy.
We note that the taxonomy we used here is focusing on pool-based classification.

- Supervised
  - model output guided selection
  - model middle information guided selection
- Unsupervised
  - only base on the original features
- [Batch mode](subfields/AL_combinations.md)

Use other research field to improve AL.
The list of works could see [here](subfields/AL_combinations.md)
- Reinforcement Learning
- Meta-learning
- Quantum computing
- GAN

Please check [here](subfields/pb_classification.md) for more information.

## AL Strategies on Different models

There are model-free AL strategies and model-dependent AL strategies.
However, even the same strategy might be implement differently on different models.
So we summarized the previous works for several models.
Hopefully this could help you easily find a appropriate AL strategy for your current model.
Specifically, we care how to apply AL strategy on each type of models in this approach.

Model list:
- SVM/LR
- Bayesian/Probabilistic
- Gaussian Progress
- Neural Network

Please check [here](AL_technique.md) form more details (Not finished yet).

# Theoretical Support for Active Learning

Might fill this slot later.

# Practical Considerations when Apply AL

When we use AL in real life scenarios, the practical situations are usually not perfectly match our problem settings introduced above.
The data, the oracle, the scale and many other situations could be really different.
In other words, this section is about what else need to be considered to apply AL strategies to meet the needs in practical problems.
Here we list the considerations potentially occurred in AL.

| Type       | Practical Considerations                                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data       | Imbalanced data                                                  |
|            | Cost-sensitive                                                   |
|            | Logged data                                                      |
|            | Feature missing data                                             |
|            | Multiple Correct Outputs                                         |
| Oracle     | The assumption change on single oracle (Noise/Special behaviors) |
|            | Multiple/Diverse labeler (ability/price)                         |
| Scale      | Large-scale                                                      |
| Other cost | Model's training cost                                            |

# Real-World Applications of AL

We have introduced that AL could be used in many [other research fields](subfields/AL_combinations.md).
In fact, AL has already been used in many real-world applications.
For many reasons, the implementations in many companies are confidential.
But we can still find many applications from several published papers and websites.

Basically, there are two types of applications: **scientific applications** & **industrial applications**.

If you are wondering how could AL be applied in many other fields, we summarized a list of works [here](subfields/AL_applications.md).

# Our Subjective Opinions on AL

Active learning has been researched over 3 decades, the fundamental theories and ideas are quite complete.
Current works are more focusing on apply AL on other research fields or looking for new applications of AL.

In my point of view, there are several directions which are promising but not fully discovered:
- Deep active learning: Because of the popularity of the deep models.
  - Cold start
  - Uncertainty measurement
  - Efficiently update model in AL process
- Stream based active learning: Most works are about pool-based AL, but the data steam is also heavily-used in daily life.
  - Selection strategy.
- Large scale active learning: AL is invented for high labeling cost situation. However, most works are just try their algorithms on a relatively small dataset.
- Practical considerations: Before utilize AL into realistic situation, there still are many technical problems.
- Application scenarios
