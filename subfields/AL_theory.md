### Optimum performance boundary
- [Towards Understanding the Optimal Behaviors of Deep Active Learning Algorithms [2021]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00977.pdf):
  Point out that there is little study on what the optimal AL algorithm looks like, which would help researchers understand where their models fall short and iterate on the design.
  Present a simulated annealing algorithm to search for an optimal strategy and analyze it for several different tasks.
