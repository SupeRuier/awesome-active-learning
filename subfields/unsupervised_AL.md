# Unsupervised AL 

This type of works aim to select the most representative samples in the absence of supervision. (Not in a interactive scheme.)(AL without oracle).
They normally reformulate the problem to Transductive Experimental Design (TED). 
TED aims to find a representative sample subset from the unlabeled dataset, such that the dataset can be best approximated by linear combinations of the selected samples.
