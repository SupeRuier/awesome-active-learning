# AL Applications

In this chapter, we will divide the works into two sections: scientific applications and industrial applications.

*(Note that the works list in this pages are works I browsed in background reading. 
There might be more important works in the corresponding fields not listed here.
Besides, I can't ensure the works are representative in the fields.
So if you have any comments and recommendations, pls let me know.)*
